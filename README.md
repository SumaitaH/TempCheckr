**Features**

* Tempcheckr extracts weather data using this API: https://developer.here.com/api-explorer/rest/auto_weather/weather-forecast-7days-simple. 

* The user can look up the weather based on the city or zip code. 

* When running the app locally, each search gets saved to a database via a servlet using a GET request. Once that information is saved, the user can browse their search history with a POST request.
